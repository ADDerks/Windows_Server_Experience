THE ATTACHED .XLSX FILE IS THE DOCUMENTATION THAT I KEPT DURING A COURSE IN WINDOWS ADMININSTRATION. 

Throughout this course we were assigned a physical server space within the Durham Tech (School) server rooom, and
instructed on how to set it up. We were given a scenario for a theorhetical company, and told to set these servers up 
to meet a list of expectations for completion of the class. We were assigned an ipv4 address range, and company name. With this
information we were expected to complete assignments given throughout the 16 weeks of coursework, and/or follow along with demonstrations 
through using our own server during class. 

In this, I gained knowledge in and experience many aspects of Server administration and Windows Server 2016. Active Directory, Adding many
users through Domain services with the use of a batch file, updating (or not updating) and why it could be a bad idea, remote accessing the
the server, setting up Group Policies and security settings, Setting up Hyper-V guests and many other things.

Everything is documented in the spreadsheet.
